# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository
Repository with data structures and algorithms coded in Java by me!

## Covered Data Structures and Algorithms

### Basic Data Structures

* Dynamic array;
* Singly linked list;
* Doubly linked list.

### Queues, Stacks and Deques

* Queue (implemented with a singly linked list);
* Stack (implemented with a singly linked list);
* Deque (implemented with a doubly linked list);
* Priority queue (implemented with a dynamic array).

### Sorting Algorithms

Algorithms created for any array that implements the Comparable interface i.e. any Comparable[] arrayReference. 

* Selection Sort;
* Insertion Sort;
* Merge Sort;
* Quick Sort;
* Heap Sort.

### Tree

* Binary Search Tree (BST).
